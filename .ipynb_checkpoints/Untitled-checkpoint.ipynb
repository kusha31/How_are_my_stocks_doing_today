       " <p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> Today we've got two hidden winners from higher inflation and a stock pitch for Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett, thank you for listening. Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Chris Hill, joined today by John Rotonti. Thanks for being here.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> Hey, Chris. I always love being on the show.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> Yesterday Bill Mann and I talked a little bit about Berkshire Hathaway, the most recent report. I wanted to delve a little bit more into it because it did get a decent amount of attention in the financial community as Warren Buffett and his letters usually do. Let's start with that. What was the highlight of the letter for you?</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> The highlight of the letter, which is nothing new, but he did emphasize it again, is that Berkshire has $144 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and the reason it's there is because the business generates a lot of free cash flow every year, and he said that he finds nothing that excites them right now, at least not in meaningful amounts, and so he can't find any businesses that he wants to buy out, and he can't find any stocks that he wants to take meaningful positions in either. So that cash just builds. It's got 144 billion. Then related to that, Chris, is the idea that he has found an alternative to making acquisitions or investing in stocks, and that alternative that he's happy with, but it is not his first choice, is to buy back Berkshire stock. In the two years, through 2020 and 2021, Berkshire spent $52 billion repurchasing about 9 percent of the shares outstanding and that has great effects on the economics of the business. One of the ones that he called out was that that actually increased the float per share by 25 percent over those two years. It is adding real per-share value. It's not his first choice, but it's a good alternative when Berkshire stock is trading at a discount to what Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger believe to be a conservative estimate of intrinsic value.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> Do you think his first choice is buying a business outright, or is his first choice finding essentially the next Apple? We can get into Apple in a second, but finding the next Apple for their portfolio?</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> It's easier to find stocks trading at a discount on the public markets because, when you buy a company outright, there's always a premium that you pay, 30-40 percent, for example. So it's easier to find bargains on the stock market, but I think, all else equal, if he could find a bargain and purchase a business outright, that would be his preference. He has said that he has got his elephant gun ready, meaning that he's got the 144 billion in cash. Now, he won't use it all. He says that they will always keep a minimum of 30 billion, but that still leaves a 115 billion or so for him to make an acquisition, 114 billion, if I do the math in my head. A hundred and fourteen billion, he could spend on an acquisition, that's just using cash. But of course, Berkshire is an incredibly resilient business with a massive balance sheet. If he wanted to, they could take on a little debt as well. This is just my analysis. I think the upper bounce is Berkshire could make a $150 billion acquisition if they really wanted to while still maintaining at least $30 billion of cash on the balance sheet.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> One of the things about Warren Buffett that I think is a great lesson for all of us as investors is, if you look at his career, and while he has been grounded in some value-oriented principles for decades, he, as an investor, is still learning. He's still evolving as an investor. When I think about the, I'm trying to think of a not-terrible adjective, let's just say the 3G Capital, the deal for <strong>Kraft </strong>that just didn't go the way he wanted it to, I look at that, and I think, even in his advanced years, he's learning. I'm not doing this again. I'm not [laughs] going this route against. So when we think about what is he going to do with that cash? I think it's safe that he's not going to be going the route that he did before.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> I would agree 100 percent with that, Chris. He admitted that they paid too much for Kraft Heinz and that company is run with an efficiency-first model where they do zero cost budgeting. They try to cut costs to the bare bones. It can lead to good business economics, but it doesn't always lead to the best workplace culture and workplace environment. I don't think that's necessarily his first choice for the type of investment he wants to make.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> Two more things from the letter and then we'll move on. First, he had a lot of praise for Tim Cook.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> [inaudible 00:05:37]</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> If you think about how that initial purchase of shares of Apple has grown over time, how they've added to that over time, I hear what you're saying about the all-in acquisition, but I don't know. I feel like if you could bet on one, it seems like the safer bet, the more likely bet is that they go out, and it seems crazy to say, they find another Apple. They find [laughs] another great business with a great leader at the top, and they say, we want to be part of this.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> I think so, Chris. Like I said, you have more frequent opportunities to find great companies trading at discounts in the stock market when you are buying a percentage of a company than when you're buying a whole company. You have to pay a premium for that whole. Apple is a one-of-a-kind business. I don't throw that phrasing around lightly. It's one of a kind because it's fully vertically integrated. They are experts at both hardware and software, as well as everything that goes in between, so the design, the supply chain, the operations. Apple has become one of the greatest semiconductor design companies on the planet, and they did so very quietly. Because of that vertical integration and that ability to excel at both hardware and software in a way that no other company on earth has shown that it can do, Apple is the greatest free cash flow generation company the world has ever seen. Buffett was able to buy stock in the company when it was trading at a discount to the market multiple. It was trading at a below-market multiple. I don't know if it's a once in a lifetime, but it's a once in a generation, once in a decade, or maybe even once in a two-decade type of investment that Buffett made. It was incredibly successful. It's going up more than 5X, and now it's $160 billion position. If I had to guess what the next company would be, like I said, it's really hard to find another Apple. I'll tell you, Chris, I wouldn't be surprised, hear me out here, if Virtue was to buy Arm out of the UK. </p>,\n",
       " <p>Arm, it's the company that Nvidia tried to buy, but it was blocked by regulators, so <strong>Nvidia </strong>dropped their quest to buy Arm. They were going to buy it for about 40 billion. Berkshire could afford this easily just from cash on the balance sheet. It's based on the UK. They're a semiconductor and IP company. They make the instruction sets that power 90 percent of the world's smartphones. If we just think about sticking with smartphones, which obviously Buffett understands because of his investment in Apple, they could buy Arm. <strong>SoftBank </strong>is now trying to IPO Arm. The reason it got blocked by regulators is because their business model has [inaudible 00:08:58] to be neutral to sell to anyone. But if it was owned by Nvidia, regulators didn't think Arm would be able to remain neutral. Under Berkshire, Arm could remain neutral. Berkshire could get it for 40 or 50 billion, somewhere around there, and two last things, it sells this mission-critical software and technology that runs 90 percent of the world's smartphones, and it's got a recurring revenue, recurring cash flows, the types of economics that Berkshire really likes. So I think they should take a look at Arm. Then lastly, that would further build out the technology investments within that Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> I just think of all the times that Jason Moser has banged the table for Berkshire Hathaway to buy <strong>McCormick</strong>, the spice company.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> Why not? Sure.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> Why not? But you make a pretty compelling case for Arm, the quote making the round for those who didn't read the letter. We're not stock-pickers. We're business pickers. You almost don't even need to read the letter to take a benefit from that. To me, I read that line, and I thought, \"Yeah, right, that's a good reminder in a market of increased volatility. Yeah, focus on the business, worry less about the stock.\"</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> Even at the Motley Fool, we've learned from Buffett and some others that speak in that language, we consider ourselves on the Investment team here at The Motley Fool business analysts. Not stock analysts, not market analysts, not traders, but business analysts. We really spend 90 percent of our time trying to understand the business and understand what that business will look like over a long period of time, and then we do spend time at the end trying to value that stock. But most of the time is understanding that business.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> Before I let you go, I would be remiss if I did not mention the fact that the last time you were on the show, we talked about <strong>Ford Motor</strong>. This was over a week ago, Ford Motor and the possibility of CEO Jim Farley splitting off the electric vehicle part of the business, and sure enough, Wednesday morning, that's exactly what happened. I just keep thinking about the conversation we had and your statement that the others are going to follow suit. It's just like, Mary Barra at <strong>General Motors</strong>, your move.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> Your move. Over to you, Mary. Exactly. I just think it makes sense. Forward stock traded up on the news, I don't know if it's seven or eight percent on the day. I do think it's a way to highlight the great things these companies are doing from an EV standpoint, and that could lead to the market rewarding these companies with higher multiples. In that, higher multiple allows them to raise capital more easily. It allows them to compete with <strong>Tesla </strong>on a more equal footing. It's not equal yet. Tesla has a lead here. Let's call it what it is, but it would allow them to compete with Tesla on a more equal footing. Yeah, I think the next part of this prediction is that the other companies follow suit.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> John Rotonti, great talking to you. Thanks for being here.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> Thank you, Chris. Thanks, Fools.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> All the talk lately of higher prices has investors asking which companies can thrive with inflation on the rise? Companies with pricing power, of course, but who else? We'll look at two unexpected beneficiaries of higher inflation. Here's Dylan Lewis.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> You know how inflation affects the broad economy and your wallet, but inflation's effect on individual companies, to understand that, we have to dig a little bit deeper. Jason Hall joins me to talk through some of the characteristics of companies that keep winning even during periods of inflation. Jason, at a very simplistic level, as a business, to be able to comfortably weather periods where things are becoming more expensive, you need to have one of two things working for you. Either upside in the price you charge for something, or control over the cost you pay for things. If you can get both, that's even better, but you really need one of those two things to be in the driver's seat.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> Absolutely. Of course, we're talking about pricing power, the ability to raise prices for various reasons, then, of course, to [inaudible 00:13:52] cost advantage, that you're actually paying for the inputs to make whatever it is that you're selling. I think sometimes, honestly, Dylan, your typical inflation environment where costs go up 1-2 percent, 2.5-3 percent a year, maybe sometimes we project a little bit there, and we find a company that we love, and then confirmation bias kicks in, and we maybe assign a little bit of these advantages, and maybe they're not real. Can it really raise prices at will? Does its scale really add up to those true cost advantages? Are they really durable? I guess that's what I'm thinking because it's really easy to pick a big profitable company. Sometimes the pricing power or sometimes the cost advantages, maybe they're not really as durable as we expect.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> We often think about pricing power through the lens of major consumer brands, like <strong>Chipotle</strong>, like <strong>Starbucks</strong>. We've talked about it a lot on the show. The loyalty allows them to charge more, but it's an active decision that the customer is going to see those higher prices, is going to see that they're paying more every single time they're getting that product. There are businesses that structurally have pricing power built into the relationships that they have for their customers in a way that I would argue is maybe a little bit more durable than those everyday purchases that consumers are making when we're often talking about pricing power.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> Starbucks is a great example. We've certainly seen that they do have the ability [laughs] to raise prices. But customers also have the ability to consume less of that product. One of the risks with these consumer discretionary companies, like Starbucks or Chipotle, if we get to a point where everything else becomes so expensive, these are the first things that come off the list of the splurge or the spend. That's a risk with those businesses. The ones that really have those advantages are the ones where the buying partner doesn't really have another choice. That's where pricing power is really powerful.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> What do you think is a good company that does a good job of illustrating that?</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> One that I really like is <strong>Mastercard</strong>. I'm a shareholder of Mastercard for a long time. It wins because of just the reality of its entire business model. It's all about activity. This is a tollbooth of a business as we get. It makes money every time a consumer buys something and that transaction goes on Mastercard rails. You go to a store, you pull out your Mastercard. You go to your favorite e-commerce website, you make a purchase, and it goes across the rails, the majority of their revenues or a percentage of that transaction. What that means is that this is a company that deal and literally benefits from high inflation because, in inflation, if something costs 10 percent more than it did a year ago, their revenue just went up 10 percent. That is incredibly powerful because they have a captive audience, and they are able to capture that right off the top.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> Those are those interchange fees that we hear so much about when we're looking at the credit card companies. It's a very different model than having someone pay a set fee basically or a regular purchase price for something that's a set amount of dollars rather than a percentage of this value that is changing and actually moving up because of inflation.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> Absolutely. The thing to me that's the most compelling about Mastercard here is that their benefit isn't the pricing power side. It's the cost advantage. Think about Starbucks. Typically, if they raise their prices, generally in this environment, what are they trying to do? They're trying to pass along higher labor costs. They're trying to pass along higher transportation to get the beans, and the cups, and all that stuff into their stores. They're not necessarily trying to make more profit off of it. They are just trying to cover their expenses. Mastercard's expenses are relatively low, and they're relatively fixed. It's dealing with labor pressure like everybody else, but it has a very highly skilled labor force, and it's more about trying to retain the best minds versus just stuff at stores. I want to give you some stats that just jumped off the page at me for Mastercard. If you look at Mastercard going back to 2010, its gross margin has generally been between 75 and 80 percent every year. That's a great gross margin. Its operating margin since 2011 has never been below 50 percent. That's just incredible. Just as a comparison, Starbucks gets, in its business, great operating margins at around 16 percent, compared to 54 percent over the trailing 12-months for Mastercard. That's a cost advantage.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> You build out that network and then you get to benefit from that network over time. That's a huge part of really why that business is as dominant as it is. I think there's a little bit of a recurring theme with some of these durable businesses. I know another company that you wanted to talk about was BIP, that's <strong>Brookfield Infrastructure Partners</strong>.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> Exactly. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners. Now, there's actually two tickers. I want to hit this real quick. There's Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, which is a limited partnership, and then there's <strong>Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation</strong>, BIPC. For our purposes, they're the same thing. They're identical economic interest in the same business and that business is very powerful. We call Mastercard a tollbooth business in maybe a metaphorical sense because it's a tollbooth for transactions. Brookfield Infrastructure is like literal tollbooths. So that's a business they actually use to operate. But now they have these businesses like telecommunications, so think about fiber optics, think about pipelines, made massive investments in literal pipelines, moving energy commodities around, electricity transmission, all of these businesses where they collect a fee, generally based on the movement of whatever that commodity is on it, whether it's data or whether it's oil or natural gas or electricity. So they collect, again, that tollbooth fee that they bring in.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This is a perfect example of their customers having one choice, and that one choice is that local monopoly that is the asset that Brookfield Infrastructure owns, or because of just the very high barriers to entry into building that asset billions of dollars to build a transmission line, ACME is not going to build one right next to it to compete. So you have that one choice, and that's very powerful. Then my favorite thing about the way that these sort of businesses work is, so you take that competitive advantage of it's the choice, you have to move your commodity to get it to your market, and then you structure your contracts if you're Brookfield so that, when inflation happens, your prices go up with the charge. Again, Mastercard, now it's not the same again, because Mastercard has as really high operating margins. The difference with Brookfield is most of its costs are capitalized. It's the infrastructure itself, it's the bricks, and mortar, and the steel pipes, that kind of stuff. It's not labor costs that necessarily flex up and down. They are higher, but again, they're relatively fixed. So inflation doesn't necessarily make its costs go higher. So when inflation happens, and it's able to raise its prices a little bit, a lot of that does come to the bottom line, and that's pretty powerful.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> Something I think is interesting with a company that is so capital-intensive, and we lose sight of this sometimes when we're talking about inflation, is usually when we're in an inflationary environment, you tend to see interest rates go up. That's one of the central banks' main ways to keep inflation in check. What does that mean for industries that have relatively big build outs in order to build the business? It means that if you're borrowing money to do that, the cost of borrowing that money is going to go up over time as well. So anyone who is structured in a very capital-intensive business, or even homeowners, really, because they have their mortgage payments locked in at a certain interest rate, are going to enjoy cost-savings that newer competitors aren't going to be able to enjoy.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> For a business like Brookfield, so its sponsor <strong>Brookfield Asset Management</strong> is this massive alternative asset manager that's been around for three decades and has a very long track record of navigating inflationary environments, geopolitical environments, interest rate environments, and you build a structure, and you have a process so that you're really focusing on return on capital. That's one of the most important metrics that you look at. So you're thinking about changing interest rate environments. Number 1, you make sure you're the guy that always has money when nobody else does. You have access to money, and you build a business so that you can benefit when others are in that position. As we see rising interest rates, and return on capital start getting squeezed for these kind of businesses because the cost of money goes up, Brookfield is going to be the company that we're going to see that's buying assets at a lower multiple, taking advantage of that market, even though its cost of capital may be higher. As a buyer, when it can buy at a lower multiple, it's still able to generate those high returns for its investors. It's an amazing boring business that people ignore that has crushed the market since it existed.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> Jason, as is often the case, when we're looking for companies that tend to thrive during blank, you could fill in whatever blank you want there, it could be inflation, it could be high interest rates, it could be geopolitical risk, it could be stay at home, they tend to be quality businesses that are in a position to control their own destiny. That comes from financial fortitude. I think as an investor, these are just a couple of reminders that it's worth digging into how the top-line manifests itself for business and how much control a company really has over its cost.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> There's no doubt about that. I think one of the things that we've seen with this growth stocks sell off over the past year, Dylan, is that so many of those businesses are burning cash. There are some that they're not profitable on a GAAP basis, but they generate positive cash flow. Those are the ones that are going to make it. The ones that are burning cash are the ones that are going to get squeezed out of existence because they don't control their destiny. That's such a differentiator for these sorts of businesses because, like I said, you want to be the guy that has money when nobody else does. You want your phone ringing. You don't want to be the one having to make the call to somebody else. These are perfect examples of that. One thing I want to point out with these two, I think is important to remember too, is that there's a big difference between Mastercard and Brookfield besides all of the obvious, but that's in the risk factors. Brookfield moves data, moves power. All of those things are largely recession-resistant. So if we see this inflationary environment start to affect consumer spending, Brookfield is the business that's going to be the less affected by it. Mastercard wins today from inflation, but if that inflation leads to a recessionary environment, it quickly becomes a loser. So I think that's an important differentiator to make as an investor thinking about the near-term implications. These are both long-term winners, but I think just being aware of those dynamics is really helpful.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> On top of all the financial stuff we just talked about with the top-line and costs, I think it's important to remember, where does this money spend fit into the overall picture for whether it's an enterprise customer, if you're a software provider or an end-consumer, if you're a consumer-packaged brand like Starbucks or Chipotle?</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> If your buyer can actively make a choice to stop buying from you on a moment's notice, that's a risk that's really important. So if you talk about those software companies selling to enterprise, the ones that have the long-term contracts and that recurring revenue, those are the ones to really focus on. The ones that have the short-term contracts where customers can walk away quickly, unless they're really sticky, they're really embedded, like Shopify, maybe there's a risk there that you don't even see. So it's always important to flip to the next page in that filing and start reading into some of those business risks.</p>,\n",

Mr. Buffett, thank you for listening. Motley Fool Money starts now. I\\'m Chris Hill, joined today by John Rotonti. Thanks for being here.</p><div class=\"interad\"></div>\\n<p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> Hey, Chris. I always love being on the show.</p>\\n<p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> Yesterday Bill Mann and I talked a little bit about Berkshire Hathaway, the most recent report. I wanted to delve a little bit more into it because it did get a decent amount of attention in the financial community as Warren Buffett and his letters usually do. Let\\'s start with that. What was the highlight of the letter for you?</p>\\n<p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> The highlight of the letter, which is nothing new, but he did emphasize it again, is that Berkshire has $144 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and the reason it\\'s there is because the business generates a lot of free cash flow every year, and he said that he finds nothing that excites them right now, at least not in meaningful amounts, and so he can\\'t find any businesses that he wants to buy out, and he can\\'t find any stocks that he wants to take meaningful positions in either. So that cash just builds. It\\'s got 144 billion. Then related to that, Chris, is the idea that he has found an alternative to making acquisitions or investing in stocks, and that alternative that he\\'s happy with, but it is not his first choice, is to buy back Berkshire stock. In the two years, through 2020 and 2021, Berkshire spent $52 billion repurchasing about 9 percent of the shares outstanding and that has great effects on the economics of the business. One of the ones that he called out was that that actually increased the float per share by 25 percent over those two years. It is adding real per-share value. It\\'s not his first choice, but it\\'s a good alternative when Berkshire stock is trading at a discount to what Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger believe to be a conservative estimate of intrinsic value.</p>\\n<p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> Do you think his first choice is buying a business outright, or is his first choice finding essentially the next Apple? We can get into Apple in a second, but finding the next Apple for their portfolio?</p><div class=\"interad\"></div>\\n<p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> It\\'s easier to find stocks trading at a discount on the public markets because, when you buy a company outright, there\\'s always a premium that you pay, 30-40 percent, for example. So it\\'s easier to find bargains on the stock market, but I think, all else equal, if he could find a bargain and purchase a business outright, that would be his preference. He has said that he has got his elephant gun ready, meaning that he\\'s got the 144 billion in cash. Now, he won\\'t use it all. He says that they will always keep a minimum of 30 billion, but that still leaves a 115 billion or so for him to make an acquisition, 114 billion, if I do the math in my head. A hundred and fourteen billion, he could spend on an acquisition, that\\'s just using cash. But of course, Berkshire is an incredibly resilient business with a massive balance sheet. If he wanted to, they could take on a little debt as well. This is just my analysis. I think the upper bounce is Berkshire could make a $150 billion acquisition if they really wanted to while still maintaining at least $30 billion of cash on the balance sheet.</p>\\n<p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> One of the things about Warren Buffett that I think is a great lesson for all of us as investors is, if you look at his career, and while he has been grounded in some value-oriented principles for decades, he, as an investor, is still learning. He\\'s still evolving as an investor. When I think about the, I\\'m trying to think of a not-terrible adjective, let\\'s just say the 3G Capital, the deal for <strong>Kraft </strong>that just didn\\'t go the way he wanted it to, I look at that, and I think, even in his advanced years, he\\'s learning. I\\'m not doing this again. I\\'m not [laughs] going this route against. So when we think about what is he going to do with that cash? I think it\\'s safe that he\\'s not going to be going the route that he did before.</p>\\n<p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> I would agree 100 percent with that, Chris. He admitted that they paid too much for Kraft Heinz and that company is run with an efficiency-first model where they do zero cost budgeting. They try to cut costs to the bare bones. It can lead to good business economics, but it doesn\\'t always lead to the best workplace culture and workplace environment. I don\\'t think that\\'s necessarily his first choice for the type of investment he wants to make.</p>\\n<p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> Two more things from the letter and then we\\'ll move on. First, he had a lot of praise for Tim Cook.</p><div class=\"interad\"></div>\\n<p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> [inaudible 00:05:37]</p>\\n<p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> If you think about how that initial purchase of shares of Apple has grown over time, how they\\'ve added to that over time, I hear what you\\'re saying about the all-in acquisition, but I don\\'t know. I feel like if you could bet on one, it seems like the safer bet, the more likely bet is that they go out, and it seems crazy to say, they find another Apple. They find [laughs] another great business with a great leader at the top, and they say, we want to be part of this.</p>\\n<p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> I think so, Chris. Like I said, you have more frequent opportunities to find great companies trading at discounts in the stock market when you are buying a percentage of a company than when you\\'re buying a whole company. You have to pay a premium for that whole. Apple is a one-of-a-kind business. I don\\'t throw that phrasing around lightly. It\\'s one of a kind because it\\'s fully vertically integrated. They are experts at both hardware and software, as well as everything that goes in between, so the design, the supply chain, the operations. Apple has become one of the greatest semiconductor design companies on the planet, and they did so very quietly. Because of that vertical integration and that ability to excel at both hardware and software in a way that no other company on earth has shown that it can do, Apple is the greatest free cash flow generation company the world has ever seen. Buffett was able to buy stock in the company when it was trading at a discount to the market multiple. It was trading at a below-market multiple. I don\\'t know if it\\'s a once in a lifetime, but it\\'s a once in a generation, once in a decade, or maybe even once in a two-decade type of investment that Buffett made. It was incredibly successful. It\\'s going up more than 5X, and now it\\'s $160 billion position. If I had to guess what the next company would be, like I said, it\\'s really hard to find another Apple. I\\'ll tell you, Chris, I wouldn\\'t be surprised, hear me out here, if Virtue was to buy Arm out of the UK.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Arm, it\\'s the company that Nvidia tried to buy, but it was blocked by regulators, so <strong>Nvidia </strong>dropped their quest to buy Arm. They were going to buy it for about 40 billion. Berkshire could afford this easily just from cash on the balance sheet. It\\'s based on the UK. They\\'re a semiconductor and IP company. They make the instruction sets that power 90 percent of the world\\'s smartphones. If we just think about sticking with smartphones, which obviously Buffett understands because of his investment in Apple, they could buy Arm. <strong>SoftBank </strong>is now trying to IPO Arm. The reason it got blocked by regulators is because their business model has [inaudible 00:08:58] to be neutral to sell to anyone. But if it was owned by Nvidia, regulators didn\\'t think Arm would be able to remain neutral. Under Berkshire, Arm could remain neutral. Berkshire could get it for 40 or 50 billion, somewhere around there, and two last things, it sells this mission-critical software and technology that runs 90 percent of the world\\'s smartphones, and it\\'s got a recurring revenue, recurring cash flows, the types of economics that Berkshire really likes. So I think they should take a look at Arm. Then lastly, that would further build out the technology investments within that Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.</p>\\n<p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> I just think of all the times that Jason Moser has banged the table for Berkshire Hathaway to buy <strong>McCormick</strong>, the spice company.</p>\\n<p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> Why not? Sure.</p>\\n<p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> Why not? But you make a pretty compelling case for Arm, the quote making the round for those who didn\\'t read the letter. We\\'re not stock-pickers. We\\'re business pickers. You almost don\\'t even need to read the letter to take a benefit from that. To me, I read that line, and I thought, \"Yeah, right, that\\'s a good reminder in a market of increased volatility. Yeah, focus on the business, worry less about the stock.\"</p>\\n<p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> Even at the Motley Fool, we\\'ve learned from Buffett and some others that speak in that language, we consider ourselves on the Investment team here at The Motley Fool business analysts. Not stock analysts, not market analysts, not traders, but business analysts. We really spend 90 percent of our time trying to understand the business and understand what that business will look like over a long period of time, and then we do spend time at the end trying to value that stock. But most of the time is understanding that business.</p>\\n<p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> Before I let you go, I would be remiss if I did not mention the fact that the last time you were on the show, we talked about <strong>Ford Motor</strong>. This was over a week ago, Ford Motor and the possibility of CEO Jim Farley splitting off the electric vehicle part of the business, and sure enough, Wednesday morning, that\\'s exactly what happened. I just keep thinking about the conversation we had and your statement that the others are going to follow suit. It\\'s just like, Mary Barra at <strong>General Motors</strong>, your move.</p>\\n<p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> Your move. Over to you, Mary. Exactly. I just think it makes sense. Forward stock traded up on the news, I don\\'t know if it\\'s seven or eight percent on the day. I do think it\\'s a way to highlight the great things these companies are doing from an EV standpoint, and that could lead to the market rewarding these companies with higher multiples. In that, higher multiple allows them to raise capital more easily. It allows them to compete with <strong>Tesla </strong>on a more equal footing. It\\'s not equal yet. Tesla has a lead here. Let\\'s call it what it is, but it would allow them to compete with Tesla on a more equal footing. Yeah, I think the next part of this prediction is that the other companies follow suit.</p>\\n<p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> John Rotonti, great talking to you. Thanks for being here.</p>\\n<p><strong>John Rotonti:</strong> Thank you, Chris. Thanks, Fools.</p>\\n<p><strong>Chris Hill:</strong> All the talk lately of higher prices has investors asking which companies can thrive with inflation on the rise? Companies with pricing power, of course, but who else? We\\'ll look at two unexpected beneficiaries of higher inflation. Here\\'s Dylan Lewis.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> You know how inflation affects the broad economy and your wallet, but inflation\\'s effect on individual companies, to understand that, we have to dig a little bit deeper. Jason Hall joins me to talk through some of the characteristics of companies that keep winning even during periods of inflation. Jason, at a very simplistic level, as a business, to be able to comfortably weather periods where things are becoming more expensive, you need to have one of two things working for you. Either upside in the price you charge for something, or control over the cost you pay for things. If you can get both, that\\'s even better, but you really need one of those two things to be in the driver\\'s seat.</p>\\n<p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> Absolutely. Of course, we\\'re talking about pricing power, the ability to raise prices for various reasons, then, of course, to [inaudible 00:13:52] cost advantage, that you\\'re actually paying for the inputs to make whatever it is that you\\'re selling. I think sometimes, honestly, Dylan, your typical inflation environment where costs go up 1-2 percent, 2.5-3 percent a year, maybe sometimes we project a little bit there, and we find a company that we love, and then confirmation bias kicks in, and we maybe assign a little bit of these advantages, and maybe they\\'re not real. Can it really raise prices at will? Does its scale really add up to those true cost advantages? Are they really durable? I guess that\\'s what I\\'m thinking because it\\'s really easy to pick a big profitable company. Sometimes the pricing power or sometimes the cost advantages, maybe they\\'re not really as durable as we expect.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> We often think about pricing power through the lens of major consumer brands, like <strong>Chipotle</strong>, like <strong>Starbucks</strong>. We\\'ve talked about it a lot on the show. The loyalty allows them to charge more, but it\\'s an active decision that the customer is going to see those higher prices, is going to see that they\\'re paying more every single time they\\'re getting that product. There are businesses that structurally have pricing power built into the relationships that they have for their customers in a way that I would argue is maybe a little bit more durable than those everyday purchases that consumers are making when we\\'re often talking about pricing power.</p>\\n<p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> Starbucks is a great example. We\\'ve certainly seen that they do have the ability [laughs] to raise prices. But customers also have the ability to consume less of that product. One of the risks with these consumer discretionary companies, like Starbucks or Chipotle, if we get to a point where everything else becomes so expensive, these are the first things that come off the list of the splurge or the spend. That\\'s a risk with those businesses. The ones that really have those advantages are the ones where the buying partner doesn\\'t really have another choice. That\\'s where pricing power is really powerful.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> What do you think is a good company that does a good job of illustrating that?</p>\\n<p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> One that I really like is <strong>Mastercard</strong>. I\\'m a shareholder of Mastercard for a long time. It wins because of just the reality of its entire business model. It\\'s all about activity. This is a tollbooth of a business as we get. It makes money every time a consumer buys something and that transaction goes on Mastercard rails. You go to a store, you pull out your Mastercard. You go to your favorite e-commerce website, you make a purchase, and it goes across the rails, the majority of their revenues or a percentage of that transaction. What that means is that this is a company that deal and literally benefits from high inflation because, in inflation, if something costs 10 percent more than it did a year ago, their revenue just went up 10 percent. That is incredibly powerful because they have a captive audience, and they are able to capture that right off the top.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> Those are those interchange fees that we hear so much about when we\\'re looking at the credit card companies. It\\'s a very different model than having someone pay a set fee basically or a regular purchase price for something that\\'s a set amount of dollars rather than a percentage of this value that is changing and actually moving up because of inflation.</p>\\n<p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> Absolutely. The thing to me that\\'s the most compelling about Mastercard here is that their benefit isn\\'t the pricing power side. It\\'s the cost advantage. Think about Starbucks. Typically, if they raise their prices, generally in this environment, what are they trying to do? They\\'re trying to pass along higher labor costs. They\\'re trying to pass along higher transportation to get the beans, and the cups, and all that stuff into their stores. They\\'re not necessarily trying to make more profit off of it. They are just trying to cover their expenses. Mastercard\\'s expenses are relatively low, and they\\'re relatively fixed. It\\'s dealing with labor pressure like everybody else, but it has a very highly skilled labor force, and it\\'s more about trying to retain the best minds versus just stuff at stores. I want to give you some stats that just jumped off the page at me for Mastercard. If you look at Mastercard going back to 2010, its gross margin has generally been between 75 and 80 percent every year. That\\'s a great gross margin. Its operating margin since 2011 has never been below 50 percent. That\\'s just incredible. Just as a comparison, Starbucks gets, in its business, great operating margins at around 16 percent, compared to 54 percent over the trailing 12-months for Mastercard. That\\'s a cost advantage.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> You build out that network and then you get to benefit from that network over time. That\\'s a huge part of really why that business is as dominant as it is. I think there\\'s a little bit of a recurring theme with some of these durable businesses. I know another company that you wanted to talk about was BIP, that\\'s <strong>Brookfield Infrastructure Partners</strong>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> Exactly. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners. Now, there\\'s actually two tickers. I want to hit this real quick. There\\'s Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, which is a limited partnership, and then there\\'s <strong>Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation</strong>, BIPC. For our purposes, they\\'re the same thing. They\\'re identical economic interest in the same business and that business is very powerful. We call Mastercard a tollbooth business in maybe a metaphorical sense because it\\'s a tollbooth for transactions. Brookfield Infrastructure is like literal tollbooths. So that\\'s a business they actually use to operate. But now they have these businesses like telecommunications, so think about fiber optics, think about pipelines, made massive investments in literal pipelines, moving energy commodities around, electricity transmission, all of these businesses where they collect a fee, generally based on the movement of whatever that commodity is on it, whether it\\'s data or whether it\\'s oil or natural gas or electricity. So they collect, again, that tollbooth fee that they bring in.</p>\\n<p>This is a perfect example of their customers having one choice, and that one choice is that local monopoly that is the asset that Brookfield Infrastructure owns, or because of just the very high barriers to entry into building that asset billions of dollars to build a transmission line, ACME is not going to build one right next to it to compete. So you have that one choice, and that\\'s very powerful. Then my favorite thing about the way that these sort of businesses work is, so you take that competitive advantage of it\\'s the choice, you have to move your commodity to get it to your market, and then you structure your contracts if you\\'re Brookfield so that, when inflation happens, your prices go up with the charge. Again, Mastercard, now it\\'s not the same again, because Mastercard has as really high operating margins. The difference with Brookfield is most of its costs are capitalized. It\\'s the infrastructure itself, it\\'s the bricks, and mortar, and the steel pipes, that kind of stuff. It\\'s not labor costs that necessarily flex up and down. They are higher, but again, they\\'re relatively fixed. So inflation doesn\\'t necessarily make its costs go higher. So when inflation happens, and it\\'s able to raise its prices a little bit, a lot of that does come to the bottom line, and that\\'s pretty powerful.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> Something I think is interesting with a company that is so capital-intensive, and we lose sight of this sometimes when we\\'re talking about inflation, is usually when we\\'re in an inflationary environment, you tend to see interest rates go up. That\\'s one of the central banks\\' main ways to keep inflation in check. What does that mean for industries that have relatively big build outs in order to build the business? It means that if you\\'re borrowing money to do that, the cost of borrowing that money is going to go up over time as well. So anyone who is structured in a very capital-intensive business, or even homeowners, really, because they have their mortgage payments locked in at a certain interest rate, are going to enjoy cost-savings that newer competitors aren\\'t going to be able to enjoy.</p>\\n<p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> For a business like Brookfield, so its sponsor <strong>Brookfield Asset Management</strong> is this massive alternative asset manager that\\'s been around for three decades and has a very long track record of navigating inflationary environments, geopolitical environments, interest rate environments, and you build a structure, and you have a process so that you\\'re really focusing on return on capital. That\\'s one of the most important metrics that you look at. So you\\'re thinking about changing interest rate environments. Number 1, you make sure you\\'re the guy that always has money when nobody else does. You have access to money, and you build a business so that you can benefit when others are in that position. As we see rising interest rates, and return on capital start getting squeezed for these kind of businesses because the cost of money goes up, Brookfield is going to be the company that we\\'re going to see that\\'s buying assets at a lower multiple, taking advantage of that market, even though its cost of capital may be higher. As a buyer, when it can buy at a lower multiple, it\\'s still able to generate those high returns for its investors. It\\'s an amazing boring business that people ignore that has crushed the market since it existed.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> Jason, as is often the case, when we\\'re looking for companies that tend to thrive during blank, you could fill in whatever blank you want there, it could be inflation, it could be high interest rates, it could be geopolitical risk, it could be stay at home, they tend to be quality businesses that are in a position to control their own destiny. That comes from financial fortitude. I think as an investor, these are just a couple of reminders that it\\'s worth digging into how the top-line manifests itself for business and how much control a company really has over its cost.</p>\\n<p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> There\\'s no doubt about that. I think one of the things that we\\'ve seen with this growth stocks sell off over the past year, Dylan, is that so many of those businesses are burning cash. There are some that they\\'re not profitable on a GAAP basis, but they generate positive cash flow. Those are the ones that are going to make it. The ones that are burning cash are the ones that are going to get squeezed out of existence because they don\\'t control their destiny. That\\'s such a differentiator for these sorts of businesses because, like I said, you want to be the guy that has money when nobody else does. You want your phone ringing. You don\\'t want to be the one having to make the call to somebody else. These are perfect examples of that. One thing I want to point out with these two, I think is important to remember too, is that there\\'s a big difference between Mastercard and Brookfield besides all of the obvious, but that\\'s in the risk factors. Brookfield moves data, moves power. All of those things are largely recession-resistant. So if we see this inflationary environment start to affect consumer spending, Brookfield is the business that\\'s going to be the less affected by it. Mastercard wins today from inflation, but if that inflation leads to a recessionary environment, it quickly becomes a loser. So I think that\\'s an important differentiator to make as an investor thinking about the near-term implications. These are both long-term winners, but I think just being aware of those dynamics is really helpful.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> On top of all the financial stuff we just talked about with the top-line and costs, I think it\\'s important to remember, where does this money spend fit into the overall picture for whether it\\'s an enterprise customer, if you\\'re a software provider or an end-consumer, if you\\'re a consumer-packaged brand like Starbucks or Chipotle?</p>\\n<p><strong>Jason Hall:</strong> If your buyer can actively make a choice to stop buying from you on a moment\\'s notice, that\\'s a risk that\\'s really important. So if you talk about those software companies selling to enterprise, the ones that have the long-term contracts and that recurring revenue, those are the ones to really focus on. The ones that have the short-term contracts where customers can walk away quickly, unless they\\'re really sticky, they\\'re really embedded, like Shopify, maybe there\\'s a risk there that you don\\'t even see. So it\\'s always important to flip to the next page in that filing and start reading into some of those business risks.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dylan Lewis:</strong> I\\'m always happy to flip through the next stage with you, Jason.

The mRNA technology has experienced decades of research efforts from scientists and various biotechnology companies. Discovered in the 1960s as an option to convert DNA codes into proteins, mRNA took several decades to emerge as promising therapeutic modality for various medical conditions. mRNA medicines make use of the usual biological processes to extract proteins and create the required therapeutic effect, due to which the treatment of several diseases that cannot be achieved using current technologies is made easy. mRNA therapeutics have gained major attention following the development of new synthesis as well as delivery approaches. The advances in the generation, purification and cellular delivery of RNA have widened the scope of RNA-based therapeutics for a broad array of applications. The technology is marked by its compelling advantages over traditional methods in terms of turnaround times, production speed and cost savings. Various clinical and preclinical studies have indicated promising results for protein replacement therapies, prevention of infectious diseases, tumor immunotherapy and cancer vaccines. In the historic global race to develop a vaccine, mRNA based Covid-19 vaccine from Moderna and Pfizer stand out as frontrunners. The unique characteristics of mRNA has made it of great interest to vaccine developers. While traditional vaccines have used live or inactivated pathogens to elicit an immune response, mRNA is responsible for cellular processes, building structures, regulating functions, and building structural components. mRNA vaccines work by introducing a part of mRNA that reacts to the viral protein. It accelerates production of antibodies and trains the immune system to recognize the virus in the future, thereby offering protection. Essentially a chemical process, production of mRNA vaccines eliminates the need for growing proteins or viruses, a key',\n",

       "  'Moderna MRNA, slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 results on Feb 24, before market open, is expected to beat expectations. In the last-reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 14.06%. Moderna’s share price has declined 8.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s decrease of 39.6%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The company’s surprise history has been mixed so far, with its earnings beating estimates in two of the trailing four quarters while missing the same twice. The average negative surprise is 35.84%. Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement. During the fourth quarter, Moderna received authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax, for use in adolsecents in several countries. Moroever, the booster or third dose also received FDA approval for emergency use in adults. In its preliminary results for 2021, the company announced that it recorded approximately $17.5 billion for the full-year from the delivery of 807 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine globally. Moderna recorded $10.7 billion of product sales in the first nine months. The company is estimated to have recorded approximately $6.8 billion in sales from Spikevax during the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for product sales stands at $6.55 billion for the fourth quarter. Investors are likely to focus on updates related to the Omicron-specific booster development progress as well as on any regulatory update related to the authorization of Spikevax for emergency use in adolescents in the United States on the fourth-quarter earnings call Moderna’s grant revenues in the fourth quarter are likely to have been driven by an award from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) under the agreement to develop its coronavirus vaccine programs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for grant revenues is pegged at $99 million. Moderna is expanding its manufacturing capabilities to support the delivery of Spikevax doses. Apart from its COVID-19 vaccine candidates, Moderna is developing 23 candidates in different stages of clinical studies, majorly mRNA-based products targeting different indications, including cancer.

(AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) have outperformed the S&P 500 by wide margins over the last decade; however, it might surprise investors to learn that AAPL traded for a P/E multiple as low as 10x in early 2016, and MSFT shares were valued at a P/E of roughly 10x as recently as 2013. Now consider this: Apple\\'s P/E multiple reached the mid-30s last year, and Microsoft\\'s P/E was in the mid-50s in 2017. This stands as a rebuttal to those who claim there is never a bad time to invest in the best companies. Investors must determine whether one or both of these firms have the growth potential to warrant current valuations. Apple has an ecosystem that creates a virtuous circle, while MSFT can count on the cloud for a growth runway that stretches for the foreseeable future. Additional developments could also bolster growth for both companies. It is hard to find fault in the latest quarterly results for Apple. When perusing the earnings call transcript, one finds the term \"all-time record\" mentioned 31 times. Apple set records for revenue ($123.9 billion, up 11%), operating cash flow ($47 billion) net income ($34.6 billion), and EPS ($2.10) in Q1 2022.

In January, it was reported that roughly 40% of the stocks within the Nasdaq had lost half their value since November. AAPL has been a safe haven for many investors, and the real question is which direction will AAPL gravitate toward in the future. I believe an argument can be made for AAPL appreciating to $250 prior to 2024 or plummeting below the $100 level if China invades Taiwan. While I don't believe anyone wants to see another war break out, both scenarios are plausible, and investors should evaluate both scenarios. AAPL has many catalysts, and something that isn't discussed enough is that AAPL can manufacture larger EPS. The market has turned its back on growth and is more concerned with a company's ability to generate free cash flow (FCF) and EPS rather than revenue growth rates. AAPL has FCF generation and EPS in spades. If China invaded Taiwan, a $100 share price for AAPL could be conservative, and shares could go lower.

Unsplash (Read more from Apple Maven: Apple Stock: EPS Growth Will Depend Mostly On This) Because of the conflict on Ukrainian soil, countries across the globe have recently announced a long list of sanctions against Russia. As a result, the country seems to be facing an economic and “financial meltdown”: ruble selloff, skyrocketing interest rates, even a run on banks. This could spell trouble for companies that do business in Russia, including those that are headquartered in Western Europe and the US. As a major global consumer products and services vendor, Apple should be impacted. The question, however, is by how much. Russia is the 11th largest economy in the world. Its GDP of about $1.5 trillion amounts to roughly 2% of the global economy — while, as a fun fact, its territory represents 11% of all land on the planet. When it comes to Apple, however, Russia is likely even less relevant. According to estimates, Apple’s Russia revenues in 2020 reached 266 billion rubles, or about $2.5 billion.

The iPhone maker made the move after calls from Ukrainian officials for tech companies to either pull back their services or stop offering them entirely in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. “We have paused all product sales in Russia,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. “Last week, we stopped all exports into our sales channel in the country. Apple Pay and other services have been limited. RT News and Sputnik News are no longer available for download from the App Store outside Russia. And we have disabled both traffic and live incidents in Apple Maps in Ukraine as a safety and precautionary measure for Ukrainian citizens,” the spokesperson added. Apple is the latest Big Tech company to punish Russia for invading Ukraine. Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook parent Meta (FB), and Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) YouTube have all blocked or limited the availability of Russian state media groups like RT and Sputnik in Europe. TikTok has also blocked the media group’s accounts in Europe. On Friday Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov called on Apple CEO Tim Cook to stop supplying its services to Russia and cut off access to the App Store. “I appeal to you and I am sure that you will not hear, but also do everything possible to protect Ukraine, Europe, and finally, the entire democratic world from bloody authoritarian aggression — to stop supplying Apple Services and products to the Russian Federation, including blocking access to the App Store!” Fedorov wrote in a letter to the CEO. Facebook parent Meta also said it’s cracking down on Russian disinformation. On Monday, the social media giant revealed that it removed a coordinated campaign designed to spread Russia-friendly disinformation with some 5,000 followers.

Apple opposed the proposal. Apple\\'s shareholders usually vote the way that management recommends, so the approval is a sign that a majority of investors believe that Apple can improve how it handles issues such as gender pay equity, leadership diversity and privacy related to products like AirTags, all of which were mentioned in the proposal. The proposal comes after a period in which Apple faced public challenges with a pay equity study run by former employee Cher Scarlett despite Apple\\'s stance that it has a gender and racial pay equity policy, and reported diversity metrics that showed that Hispanic and Black employees only represent a small percentage of technology employees and leadership roles at Apple. Shareholders also narrowly approved a separate shareholder proposal directing Apple to create a public report about how the company uses concealment clauses in employment contracts with respect to harassment and discrimination.

Today\\'s Apple is a far cry from what Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs built 46 years ago. \"Our story may not have appealed to a lot of the investment community when we started Apple,\" Wozniak said in an exclusive interview with Insider. \"The big computer companies said we were going to turn out to be nothing big.\" After leaving Apple in the mid-1980s, Wozniak embarked on a series of other business ventures, both as a founder and an investor. Now, the tech luminary has added yet another line to his lengthy résumé — investing panelist on the reality show \"Unicorn Hunters.\" \"Unicorn Hunters\" features hopeful entrepreneurs who pitch their businesses, which are mostly skewed toward the health-tech sector, to a panel of seasoned investors such as Wozniak, \\'N Sync\\'s Lance Bass, former US Treasurer Rosa Rios, and the tech mogul Alex Konanykhin. The panel then asks the founders questions to uncover any risks or weaknesses before determining whether the idea is worthy of investment. For Wozniak, who draws much of his investment criteria from his experiences founding Apple, the role of panelist is one he takes seriously. \"I\\'m very skeptical,\" he said. \"I want to ask the questions that investors have asked me when I had small startups.\" On the business side, Wozniak examines a slew of technical and operational factors, like the fairness of the product\\'s pricing or how the number of shares offered translates to percentage ownership. More importantly, Wozniak prefers to analyze the engineering behind the inventions. Fundamentally, Wozniak said he looked at two things when investing: \"the product',\n",
       "  \"Silicon Valley’s tech giants are joining the rest of the business world in pulling their products and services from Russia. Companies like Apple (AAPL) have cut ties to the Russian market entirely to protest the invasion of Ukraine, while firms like YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL) , Meta (FB), and Microsoft (MSFT) are limiting the availability of Russian propaganda networks like RT and Sputnik in Europe. And while Big Tech’s moves put at least some pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and provide assistance to Ukrainian citizens, they can also be a boon for the companies’ bottom lines. And for companies awash in controversy, taking action against Russia can improve their standing among consumers. “We want to think that this is altruistic and companies taking a stand, but sometimes it's also value washing,” Forrester senior analyst Alla Valente told Yahoo Finance. “In other words, if a brand has had some bad media or publicity they could be doing this to try and repair their brand reputation.” Among major tech brands, Apple is taking the strongest stance against Russia. The company has stopped all product sales in the country, limited services like Apple Pay, removed the RT and Sputnik apps from the App Store everywhere except inside Russia, and disabled traffic and live incidents in Apple Maps to prevent Russia from seeing where Ukrainian citizens may be gathering. Apple doesn’t have any physical stores in Russia, meaning its products are sold through third-party retailers. And according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, cutting Russia off from hardware sales won’t put much of a dent in Apple’s bottom line. “Russia overall is breadcrumbs in terms of its financial impact to U.S. tech giants,” Ives told Yahoo Finance. “If FAANG names pulled the plug on doing business in Russia it’s maximum 1%-2% overall revenue exposure.” Apple has long made human rights one of the cornerstones of its appeal, even if it's to its detriment at times. It famously pushed back against the Department of Justice when investigators demanded Apple create a backdoor for iOS to gain access to an iPhone used by one of the killers\"],\n",

       "  'As commodities prices spike and stocks swoon as a result of Russia waging war against Ukraine, the monetary system could be changed in profound ways, some analysts say. At some point in the future, digital tokens may revert to the inflation hedge and safe-haven from fiat turmoil, as envisioned when they were first created. Traditional safe havens like gold, U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar have surged in the current environment of risk-aversion. In a recent analysis, Zoltan Pozsar, global head of short-term interest strategy with Credit Suisse, said the crisis-level crunch could eventually benefit Bitcoin after the current market bedlam passes. \"We are witnessing the birth of Bretton Woods III – a new world (monetary) order centered around commodity-based currencies in the East that will likely weaken the Eurodollar system and also contribute to inflationary forces in the West,\" Pozsar wrote in a research note. Amid the unfolding crisis, Pozsar added that the turmoil — partly inspired by punitive Western sanctions against Russia — is enhancing the \"allure\" of other forms of money, the analyst noted. \"Bretton Woods II was built on inside money, and its foundations crumbled a week ago when the G7 seized Russia’s FX reserves,\" he added. Digital tokens and crypto-related stocks have been largely tracking risk appetite in equities. Crypto-related names like Microstrategy (MSTR) (-7.6%), Coinbase (COIN) (-17%) and Marathon (MARA) (-14%) continue to sell off relative to BTC. Changing just below $39,000 on Tuesday, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is down 13% over the past week, but traded flat on the day. The global market cap for cryptocurrencies shed a staggering $4.3 billion overnight, and sits at $1.74 trillion according to asset research firm, Fundstrat. The second largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH-USD) has sold off 2% for the same period, down almost 15% loss over the past week. It\\'s 24-hour put/call ratio has climbed to an 5-month high, according to Coinbase Skew, which signals bearish investors are emboldened. Still, BTC is faring better than most other digital coins, even though the narrative of it being a safe-haven has been put to rest by recent price action. In the',\n",
       "  'Shares of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks slump amid risk-off move Written by Aditya Raghunath at The Motley Fool Canada With over 17,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation, it’s quite difficult to identify long-term winners that have the potential to grow investor wealth at an exponential rate. Unlike equities, it’s hard to fundamentally value cryptocurrencies. But you can try to analyze real-world utilities of the underlying blockchain networks, which should drive demand for the digital tokens higher. Here, I’ll compare two cryptocurrency giants in Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) and Terra (CRYPTO:LUNA) to deduce which is a better investment at current prices. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world and is valued at a market cap of US$303.7 billion. Launched in 2015, the ETH token has gained 3,46,000% in fewer than seven years. So, a $100 investment in ETH back in August 2015 would be worth close to $350,000 today. The Ethereum blockchain was among the first to support the execution of smart contracts. Its first-mover advantage has allowed Ethereum to onboard over 2,000 projects on its rapidly expanding network. A majority of these projects are in the decentralized finance space that aims to replace legacy banking products and services. Ethereum validates transactions on a mechanism called proof-of-work, or PoW. Developers solve complex transactions that let them mine the next “block” of the blockchain. The PoW mechanism, while extremely secure, is costly and slow. Ethereum’s gas fees are much higher compared to Solana’s while its transaction speed is considerably lower. Ethereum is all set to transition towards a proof-of-stake (PoS) network, where you stake digital tokens, which will let you validate the next block of transactions. The shift towards PoS should resolve cost and scalability issues tied to the Ethereum network, allowing it to expand its ecosystem at a solid pace going forward. Around 40 of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap are built on the Ethereum network due to the advantages and utilities mentioned above. Ethereum is also the largest host for NFT (non-fungible token) marketplaces, which could enable the network to gain traction in the metaverse segment as well. If an NFT is based',\n",

       "  \"Last month, Twitter sleuths uncovered a cache of homophobic and transphobic posts from Brantly Millegan, director of the Ethereum Name Service Foundation (ENS), roiling the crypto community. “Homosexual acts are evil. Transgenderism doesn’t exist. Abortion is murder. Contraception is perversion. So is masturbation and porn,” read one of Millegan’s tweets from May 2016. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. Responding to backlash, Millegan doubled down, chalking up the perspective to his Catholic faith. “Nice to see some ppl finally read the first word of my bio,” he wrote (his Twitter bio says “Catholic, husband, father”). It was enough to get him fired from his position as director of operations at True Names Limited, the Singapore-based nonprofit that organizes and funds the Ethereum Name Service. After two days of deliberation, Nick Johnson, Millegan’s boss at True Names and the founder of ENS, said he felt Millegan’s position was “no longer tenable.” The catch is that while Millegan had been removed from True Names Limited, he wasn’t really gone from the organization as a whole – and in a vote that ended this past weekend, the community confirmed that Millegan will stay on as director of the ENS Foundation and remain a core developer on the project. That’s because, somewhat confusingly, “ENS” refers to a multi-part organizational structure, as opposed to a single company. ENS is a program on the Ethereum network, a system for turning long, numerical Ethereum addresses into text-based shortcuts. It functions like a top-level domain on the internet we’re already used to. In the way that the “.com” suffix shortens an otherwise unwieldy IP address into something handy and readable (e.g. “google.com” instead of “142.250.65.238”), the “.eth” suffix gives traders a quick way to identify a specific address on the Ethereum network. The ENS Foundation is a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, the legal entity behind ENS. It’s governed by the ENS DAO (decentralized autonomous organization), which is essentially a crypto-backed voting service on\",\n",

If the last 12 months in cryptocurrency has taught us anything, it's that people really like owning a piece of code that proves they overpaid for a JPEG file. And it's not just about monkey pictures either. Soon NFTs (non-fungible tokens) will be used to trade music rights, real estate and debt instruments. NFTs have a strange relationship with cryptocurrencies. It’s similar to that of a parent and child. When the NFT market was small, it depended on the crypto markets for its price action, but as they have matured, they have been breaking away. When the cryptocurrency market did its best impression of a downhill ski slope in January, NFTs were booming, with NFT trading platform OpenSea recording $5 billion in sales volume, an all-time high. Some crypto observers thought that meant there was a reverse correlation between crypto and NFT markets: When bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market goes up, NFTs go down, and vice versa. Others have pointed out times when both markets have moved in sync as was the case recently when NFTs sank along with the rest of the market when the war in Ukraine began. Professional research on NFTs is thin, because just a couple of years ago, most of the market didn’t exist. One study that looked into the subject is titled “Is Non-Fungible Token Pricing Driven by Cryptocurrencies?” by Dublin City University professor Michael Dowling. “Anyone active in the NFT market will be aware of the strong crossover between cryptocurrency market participants and NFT market participants,” the paper states. That is partly because to buy an NFT you need to use cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, a nontrivial level of complexity for many people. Crypto exchange Coinbase, however, plans to make participation easier. Its much anticipated NFT marketplace will allow users to buy NFTs with fiat using their credit cards. Indeed, companies like eBay, Reddit and Instagram all have plans to integrate NFTs, also likely\",\n",

Just a few weeks ago Sean Havens (founder) began sharing insight into the core values that make up his medieval themed NFT project, Knights of Havenly. The founder has said on multiple occasions that he and the team are striving for excellence in their uniqueness, which to him, means taking the best pieces of the web3 world without any of the shortcuts and also incorporating his visions of what true community creativity could be. With Sean\\'s many years of community building on his social media platforms and his passion for blockchain technology, he has expressed how he hopes to create an imaginative world of duality for investors & creatives alike. The spine of the project will be a holder-influenced, adventure packed, animated NFT web series. The series will feature randomly selected knights (from the collection) that will embark on many epic quests, all while testing each one’s personality and skill level. The randomized chances could give any given NFT much more perceived value by playing a vital role in the plot development. Holders will get the chance to see their character come to life and interact with other NFT knights throughout the lifetime of the story. Unlike a normal series, the Knights of Havenly holders have a say via voting power to navigate \"fork-in-the-road\" decision making within the storyline. Each majority decision creates a butterfly effect that could change the direction of the series all together. The Knights of Havenly (AKA \"KOH\") NFT project consists of 777 Genesis scroll NFTs (released on 2.22.22), and a forthcoming collection of 5,555 fully-3D warrior knights.

       "  \"Cryptocurrency is playing a significant role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has helped to facilitate the flow of needed funds to Ukrainian citizens and soldiers. The Ukrainian government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) supporting the military effort have raised $59.2 million in crypto donations, even as digital coin exchanges face pressure to curtail transactions from non-sanctioned Russians. Those funds are dwarfed by the billions Ukraine is receiving from NATO allies, but the outpouring of crowdsourced crypto donations have been a boon to the country, according to Alex Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation. “In times like these, response time is crucial. Crypto is playing a role to give us flexibility to respond really quickly to deliver the army’s required supplies,” Bornyakov told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview. As Russian bombs strafed major cities, Bornyakov was forced to evacuate Kyiv on February 24. Two days later, Bornyakov’s boss, Ukrainian vice prime minister, Mykhalio Federov, posted Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) wallet addresses over Twitter, requesting crowdsourced crypto donations. According to data tracked by the blockchain analytics firm, Elliptic, the majority of donations to Ukraine have been paid in Ether and Bitcoin, but donors have also sent the PolkaDot cryptocurrency (DOT-USD) as well as stablecoins like Tether (USDT-USD) and even a Crypto Punk NFT. Cryptocurrencies have offered faster transaction times, though not all suppliers still accept it as payment, according to Bornyakov. Currently, the government converts the donated crypto assets into dollars or euros through the Ukrainian exchange, Kuna, which also custodies the funds. Last week the Ukrainian government teased “airdropping” rewards to crypto donors, potentially in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which caused government donations to surge. Originally, “an initiative to create awareness” crypto investors quickly sent smaller amounts in anticipation of rewards. Yet the government decided to push back the reward offer amid mounting cyber security concerns stemming from the invasion. “Maybe it's going to be airdropped at some point but right now, Russia is very active in their military actions so we need to focus on defending our country rather than going further with the\",\n",
       "  'Payrolls rise by 678,000 as unemployment rate falls to 3.8% Written by Andrew Button at The Motley Fool Canada Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) has been trending downward in 2022. As of this writing, it was down 21% for the year, while Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) was only down 8%. Cryptocurrencies are generally very correlated with each other, so it should come as no surprise that ETH and BTC are down at the same time. However, it is a little bit unusual for ETH to be down so much more than Bitcoin. The general trend since Ether’s launch has been one of closing in on Bitcoin’s market cap. Generally, ETH has delivered higher returns than Bitcoin has over the former’s lifetime. That’s beginning to change. In this article I will explore some possible reasons why it’s happening. One possible reason why ETH is declining in price so much this year is that the NFT fad is waning. NFTs are unique tokens bought with Ether that point to images and other digital assets. You can think of NFTs as a form of digital art. People buy NFTs hoping to see them go up in value. They may also feel that an NFT confers “ownership” of the image that it points to. Whatever the case may be, NFTs were very popular last year. Some of them sold for over $10 million. It was a pretty popular fad. But today, it is waning. If you search ‘NFT’ on Google Trends, you will notice that search queries for the term have been declining since mid-January. NFTs are bought and sold with ETH, which was previously a factor driving demand for Ether. Now, NFTs are losing their cachet, and perhaps fewer people are buying ETH as a result. Another factor contributing to the decline of Ether is a broader decline in the cryptocurrency market. As previously mentioned, cryptocurrencies are highly correlated with one another. Generally, whenever Bitcoin is going up, the most popular alt-coins are going up along with it. The reverse is also true. Bitcoin and most major cryptocurrencies are going down this year, so it should come as']}"
